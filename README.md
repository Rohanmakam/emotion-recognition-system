In this project, we developed a machine learning model for emotion recognition by facial expression using Back Propagation algorithm. We collected and pre-processed a dataset of images with labelledemotions, trained a neural network using Back Propagation 
algorithm. The results showed that our model was able to achieve high accuracy in recognizing emotions from facial expressions. Finally, we can explore the applications of emotion recognition by facial expression in various domains, such as mental health, humancomputer interaction, and robotics. Overall, this project provides a 
solid foundation for future research in emotion recognition by facial 
expression using back propagation algorithm.
